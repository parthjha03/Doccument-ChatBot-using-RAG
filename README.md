# DocuAI - Intelligent Document Assistant

DocuAI is a Flask-based web application that enables users to upload, process, and interact with documents (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, TXT) using natural language. It leverages advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques, semantic search, and large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate, context-aware answers to user queries about their documents. The system supports multilingual queries, voice input, and a modern chat interface.

## Features

- **Document Upload:** Supports PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and TXT files.
- **Semantic Chunking:** Splits documents into meaningful chunks using spaCy.
- **Embeddings & Vector Search:** Generates embeddings (DeepInfra/OpenAI API) and stores them in Pinecone for semantic search.
- **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines vector similarity (Pinecone) and BM25 keyword search, reranked by a cross-encoder for best relevance.
- **LLM-Powered Q&A:** Uses Groq API to rewrite queries and generate grounded, context-aware answers.
- **Multilingual Support:** Detects and translates queries/responses using `langdetect` and `deep-translator`.
- **Voice Input:** Users can ask questions via speech, transcribed and translated as needed.
- **Modern Web UI:** Responsive chat interface with document upload, language selection, and voice controls.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/parthjha03/Doccument-ChatBot-using-RAG.git
   cd docuai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:
     ```
     MODEL=your_groq_model_name
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
     INDEX_NAME=your_pinecone_index_name
     DEEPINFRA_API_KEY=your_deepinfra_api_key
     ```

4. **Download spaCy model:**
   ```sh
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   python app2.py
   ```

6. **Access the app:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

## Example Query Flow

1. User uploads a document.
2. User asks a question (text or voice, any language).
3. System translates and rewrites the query for optimal retrieval.
4. Relevant document chunks are retrieved and reranked.
5. LLM generates a grounded answer using the retrieved context.
6. Answer is translated back to the user's language and displayed.
